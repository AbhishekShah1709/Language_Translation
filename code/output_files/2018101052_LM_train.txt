Resumption of the session	1.0
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	25.529742873051195
Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	50.32469705284732
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	16.455699307392216
In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	23.914924763665542
Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	21.39849553802591
(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)	6.536842377036404
Madam President, on a point of order.	24.51997884073213
You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	27.898786630196202
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	38.03673098641221
Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	67.29836075837021
Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	172.71298766196475
If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	57.673060529926865
Madam President, on a point of order.	24.51997884073213
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	121.02673114294426
My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	66.22375613364629
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	129.06946235825632
It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	21.577671755506113
I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	34.96942170115011
I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	108.47742243937927
That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	36.419351000545255
Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. We shall call him Mr Hicks.	73.06747021869614
At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself.	140.40531310311917
However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	46.14576108657911
This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	24.86771918245001
Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	26.736829014661296
Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	105.18188800051152
Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	22.302105972260367
It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	14.304308374527373
All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	131.87011530961385
Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	86.59012794754962
We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	67.80839577233863
These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	40.98801153058405
Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	32.69223181375113
Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	51.557982451774556
But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	64.46010569013286
Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	103.03058342709869
I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	51.69403339758316
Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	17.548209375821948
It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	135.07122209323566
Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	66.59099365957779
Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	168.2833435250224
Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	699.4962657823808
Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	42.85472635615305
Why are there no fire instructions?	95.13472553944972
Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	139.42017224613608
Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	122.08277130426393
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	45.875677179718295
Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	64.59999985819563
I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	35.83432870543816
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	35.551577687253236
The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	45.18099811577812
I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	53.03621275197893
The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	33.64634885665585
Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	28.77160787215619
I admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused.	79.25434950917601
We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	40.076661892865836
Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	41.46816844819277
Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	83.73458209155498
So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	62.43262147939063
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	40.64919888867158
As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	93.99338642429434
There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	38.366361268616394
We do not know what is happening.	12.589973074780485
So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	63.068081186024614
In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	44.29836308684329
Agenda	1.0
The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	22.980065913076437
No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	196.74113962541028
Relating to Wednesday:	1.0
The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	26.247589078684715
I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it. That is, if he so wishes, of course.	77.29455596757354
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	206.9408458506443
Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	27.501162113887723
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	33.933369613017554
I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature. It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	53.1179203365378
There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	44.28871612270491
To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	28.209712704031773
The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma. Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	81.1068795268403
According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	12.37144338624082
Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed. Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	77.64318759659842
In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	72.45719594572931
My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	44.28274460403503
Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	40.48411491520911
Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	20.090752543901058
(Applause from the PSE Group)	1.378650187611356
Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	41.00399422154612
We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	338.7212472706651
But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	23.984549857992754
Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	34.06765504381672
I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	44.5883691548789
Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	27.0619758973055
I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	19.23071324793195
(Parliament rejected the request) President.	192.13114725937928
Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	47.062417377143504
The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	30.512759158296213
Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	16.182565464963456
Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists. I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	36.2890732010033
I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	88.06251115001058
Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	87.20882689989476
That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	36.09843941029478
Thank you, Mr Poettering.	1.0
We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	76.05811350869293
Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	18.46927332125575
He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	31.30836274403858
We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups. As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	70.22990257499163
It is not a lot to ask.	25.954130481341373
I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	37.181608180710285
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	30.523810737417364
(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	134.06530049162723
Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	9.979172649465836
Thank you very much.	1.0
Madam President, has my vote been counted? I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	67.21589954938302
My vote was "in favour" .	2.9307609862162383
Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	57.89435449707573
Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	43.32671525262667
There is no room for amendments.	8.343136706665543
Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	34.08423243657447
That did not happen.	1.0
I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	44.97225353102123
This is an important matter.	51.335312720133935
It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	46.510813793786006
Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	26.93016809146855
You did not call me either.	151.21229267154905
I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	68.89013174936075
I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox. I did not see you asking to speak.	41.535120882576386
Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	69.65037055932287
When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	146.53540276631782
This seems to me to be a workable solution.	25.566883559814553
Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	41.44795519363285
I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	262.7823064367653
Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	54.21881986055162
Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	180.0630182000292
If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	86.35103748562643
We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	33.80837730545303
If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	172.98784324842458
(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	388.1130267121144
Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	7.596331440753329
The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	5.867621977093471
Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	11.174105719956085
Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	29.630592623550527
Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	66.17759723825478
Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	64.04241657937082
All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	25.93300541710516
Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	145.25666243551
They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	105.71927943472559
The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	26.05512067305027
By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	34.73877351418077
I would urge you to endorse this.	17.035309261456156
Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	76.57678078292116
As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	73.11669989151093
The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	92.22522752056456
The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	43.09597441359983
In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	47.46246915031662
Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	91.09377538924522
All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	81.52972283641084
We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	43.299708128485385
Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	55.300656930696356
I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	55.94541083097921
In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	55.00619626763746
Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	21.7483334188341
The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	14.531177101805504
I congratulate him on his excellent report.	10.665341738509753
Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	69.26224824051663
The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	64.08010128279717
My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	57.66384914405033
When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	213.17481784335172
We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	38.72855379455008
Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	4.341487839042385
I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	32.25418228137758
We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	55.012972950957185
This is a pity, in a sense.	17.163229882220044
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	42.785660604252506
This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	31.27185167664149
Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead.	58.31734594485598
Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	49.221133938907144
Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	103.37743608915709
In short, the issue is an important one.	16.66764575123633
If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	54.860755166185186
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	122.9891758249726
These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	129.8676362526987
It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	57.30987838520162
The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement.	217.5385518571812
I would like to mention one final point.	90.9285596296511
With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	55.94719882916172
This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	63.622120435571546
This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	47.62191151720914
Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	37.10584326435114
The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	115.68883563486328
Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	141.50972886606826
The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	46.712714312780946
I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	90.16472333173309
This, however, does not seem feasible.	643.3135879971021
Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	38.35000035795898
Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	73.12407252004179
I should like to make just a few comments.	20.16482381011612
Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	48.16237977919889
Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	89.59787235319966
This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	21.738758185605548
My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	34.94097961090324
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	109.88137970645317
However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	157.36820958128442
I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	53.138630037223955
Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	159.95072593770809
My third point has also been mentioned already.	70.20501164553045
As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	47.918284682845105
We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	105.71626208497649
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	49.26176640572448
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	21.610882440445955
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	45.44675765481626
The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	35.76516385673937
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	20.40968886755518
As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	90.5114167730314
The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	135.4446832133129
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	35.803482703383004
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	200.2483807593483
Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	91.51719665772144
Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	70.58328611109715
Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	29.30515578876577
This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	29.50491630932922
But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	28.78249059223998
As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	42.86862574929466
I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	34.12500309140013
The debate is closed.	1.0
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.765906063781515
Transport of dangerous goods by road	2.379193496478712
The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	4.854114154280574
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.	26.33778624511382
Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive.	36.84099397836018
In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments.	45.4149271172215
I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job.	41.72318192805589
In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today.	25.292938609963606
Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	91.09291144220704
The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community.	29.985575275588065
It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas.	65.81366440673499
The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers.	61.78289026699016
The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure.	37.35109449090304
The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	34.70306327637844
The proposal to be discussed today, to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road, dates from May 1999, however, and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure.	36.72691735015066
Two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure.	96.78835914647165
We would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the Council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months.	47.66806842859783
In addition, the need for greater transparency has been pointed out.	20.649961879625007
A further amendment allows the Member States to impose more stringent requirements, in particular for vacuum tanks, if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºC. This is in the special interest of northern European regions.	85.38708951095803
A final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 January 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it.	30.65950792096425
I do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety, but I would ask you to endorse this report.	28.460105512891573
Mr President, colleagues, a happy new year and millennium to you all.	337.6286900901411
I am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session, so this is quite exciting for me, a little like first love, although that did last longer than two minutes.	57.460945077713724
I would like to briefly comment on the Commission' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road.	7.834518757423352
It is good that this directive should be established now, as, otherwise, Member States would have to amend their national acts for a very short time, a period of transition, which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to EU bureaucracy.	102.28711410419864
The Commission' s proposal, however, does not take account of all the facts, such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions.	42.486756679826826
Consequently, I have tabled some amendments to Mr Koch' s intrinsically excellent report, which have been adopted by our committee.	18.22819535716182
My amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods.	95.98230123541299
According to the Commission' s proposal -20ºC would have been sufficient. On the shores of the Mediterranean, it is hard to imagine that in Lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that.	39.46396520129093
There is support for the EU in Lapland also, so let us remember them.	73.21361602668077
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.	70.89444164997414
This would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously.	99.02923330811177
I hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow' s vote.	14.533288859979555
Mr President, with your permission I should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate.	30.004147846420246
I thought that it was quite superb.	84.27791990383211
On the subject at hand, I think that the people of Europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on Europe's roads, railways, and so on are as safe as possible.	67.73762720886269
This directive is a contribution to this.	21.462085669913844
What we are doing today is essentially a nuisance.	146.11218331513476
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	45.92826742644469
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	50.02309801713381
Mr President, the report we are discussing here does not, in itself, entail any major changes.	102.78293900519587
Most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature.	65.30723626526239
It is nonetheless worth emphasising that, each time we make this type of decision, it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market.	59.56809562927442
Very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the EU, both on roads and railways and by sea.	44.7414516733108
This makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind.	80.98229817660979
In area after area, we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the Member States.	44.896535221130684
This is extraordinarily positive, and there is cause to thank the rapporteur, Mr Koch, for the work he has put in on this issue.	25.350728422810832
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned.	41.234102116723854
If we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running, it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also, as far as possible, apply to every country.	76.60593016697807
I should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance, namely an amendment tabled by Member of Parliament, Mr Ari Vatanen.	72.9398520915968
In many ways, the prerequisites differ from one Member State to another.	48.12249765634756
By approving this amendment, we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the European Union.	19.041287759093706
This makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind.	41.18109097464837
It is good that, in establishing the present regulations, we can also be flexible.	98.32058037922563
I hope that the Commission is able to accept the present amendment.	15.245564491932907
Mr President, I would like to thank not only Mr Koch, but also the Vice-President of the Commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority.	36.47716524922606
The reason Mr Koch produced his sound report was because the work in the CEN and within the United Nations Economic Commission was proceeding none too expeditiously.	160.1376790542128
I would like to ask the Vice-President if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations, and whether the EU is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts, in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible.	57.752194870443304
For one thing is clear: even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the European Union, traffic does not stop at our borders, it goes beyond them.	84.80189082181631
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.	202.4032054895828
If the Commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the CEN and the Economic Commission are at?	85.38194825787369
Mr President, I would once again like to congratulate Mr Koch on his magnificent work on this other report, which in a way supplements the debate which we held in October on rail transport.	41.259311141960495
We all regret that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) has not been able, in the required time, to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the European Union.	38.39002996717509
This debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this Europe of ours.	72.03083644659623
A moment ago, Mr Vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures, not of 20 degrees below zero, but of 40 degrees below zero.	77.04978689515222
Of course, we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and I believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the European Union, which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature.	36.06802996042015
I would like to say, with regard to Mr Swoboda' s comments on the activity of the CEN, that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if, despite the new deadline, we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded.	37.16443348044868
Lastly, Mr President, the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out. We have referred to the delay by the CEN, the amendment of certain provisions, the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific.	35.38996733667356
The Commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur, Mr Koch, which are contained in the various amendments, specifically four.	27.602236781107475
We therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed.	29.234642229432776
The debate is closed.	1.0
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.765906063781515
Structural Funds - Cohesion Fund coordination	743.6503843507065
The next item is the report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 [COM(1999)344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)].	6.549367229455249
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.	39.49789584968269
A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme.	61.70104597433438
It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face.	61.085096991010325
We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997.	500.104173190427
We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen.	105.47196733367542
We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.	55.74341231700865
What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces.	68.58535410229251
That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.	22.311454925511473
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.	38.01288508435636
We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures.	99.14559041713237
We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects.	47.16170726513371
We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage.	50.356352325146666
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	42.82999618553223
Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent.	65.83845089805274
This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales.	30.090969571128955
Mr President, our committee views these issues very differently and, to start, I will speak from the point of view of research.	99.34049888256578
We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee' s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts.	54.30931870270576
This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.	159.22051670972206
Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds.	36.31834692129968
Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood.	311.8143800222544
The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future.	90.9888693507652
In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission' s attention to this issue.	29.52997172647336
Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.	80.63160436486542
Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that I am speaking for my colleague, Mrs Flautre, who followed this for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but who is unfortunately ill.	32.63684139774935
I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.	11.990505559716349
These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.	58.76780494386715
In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment.	76.14608272058412
These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action.	100.97234360276703
We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.	96.80002470979807
In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed.	98.41672712591689
The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.	42.78022442725733
But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme.	52.70099118287298
It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment.	60.7107863191539
We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively.	28.349824103939106
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposal presented by the Commission, in accordance with its mandate, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	19.512059084763905
I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society.	79.7167916003499
This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas.	58.794628795647995
The consequences do not inspire hope.	106.05087169715318
It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.	92.59994055602233
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.	25.084420747443552
We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union.	23.533570339179423
Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union.	23.08709911876529
Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.	238.71547825280024
For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.	48.02068629497657
Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.	39.95957087748515
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.	40.79773754810356
In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives.	41.56229346511439
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Schroedter, the rapporteur, for her work.	7.339813251683638
I think that this work has been carried out extremely well.	68.26691091339313
I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing.	50.81299918818761
We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air.	51.9278171686486
The truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives.	42.15371111171914
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.	54.65360927254706
In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative.	80.75553083849492
Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds.	28.113534904201583
If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly.	111.36421890369324
Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies.	82.3399761125816
All of this must be done - I repeat - with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs.	72.74019062469691
Mr President, it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague, Mr Evans, of why Wales actually achieved Objective 1 status.	108.97582188206249
It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party.	69.11296475656938
Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements.	66.71180724767814
I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality.	86.73071982272631
I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.	131.85482756368853
My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today.	344.3938789782101
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.	21.598333421206817
The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.	95.6805206188089
It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector.	33.48750597423241
It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.	48.296255506495235
The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about.	79.04405269761666
They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape.	97.31486020364
They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.	93.69165400872387
The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service.	54.205226562343455
There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.	158.58518414769713
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.	84.8133358511581
If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success.	90.03279965698285
This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU.	70.32018534547879
Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for an excellent report. She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report.	29.767743948377426
The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines.	100.03404288279812
We are badly behind now in this matter.	28.390812152274407
Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation.	74.84279765124127
For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated.	153.15139100284122
It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports.	56.62891425009817
At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.	35.15982167104203
Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes.	28.569947979523423
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.	38.50882586096311
Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas.	39.0966566414856
We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes.	35.16831414975367
Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes.	142.2614389524949
Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned.	97.35682132016481
Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.	24.20316703521713
While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union' s regional policy in general.	47.86074217267895
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	26.20747242497312
This report is very good and our Group supports it.	120.32325319192552
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.	40.845737965710995
Bearing this in mind, this House should, in any event, demand that, before the Community support frameworks for the period in question are approved, they be studied and submitted for debate in this Parliament, specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today.	94.84332174942968
This is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in European society and to the move towards a fairer Europe.	49.724344396464105
Mr President, we should not forget that the main, strategic objective of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion.	25.273142589889368
We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results.	100.65784110407003
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	31.627135470658438
We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion.	56.91238384366538
We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator.	44.777708609899065
Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population.	192.91153669290787
We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving.	81.19913123502121
It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament' s plenary sitting today that Europe' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions.	73.43196008501309
This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically.	41.57442834592778
I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives.	35.75567019191654
I do not think, however, that this report has come too late.	43.60904922100541
We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment.	59.52644599078233
We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives.	61.74726334995361
Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic.	40.35153318240247
They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens.	138.24657492728554
This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for.	29.741416935824116
I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity.	125.24933624320126
Mr President, I support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2000-2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following: there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.	23.603599373802556
This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.	31.405875191346937
Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas.	23.09710340769902
This latter point is of particular importance.	117.86618325449786
While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers.	59.25652332736202
We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.	33.09058870152938
The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks.	55.181474585439645
This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.	67.76844147441027
Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe.	44.65307737183824
The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.	49.02090938579269
In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society.	33.699888076008904
The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy.	204.6534965054451
Mr President, on numerous occasions in the past I have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues. This time, however, I actually agree with her.	40.89752328594081
Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work.	38.57810011305204
The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked.	42.335865408780535
Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee.	40.232684098168804
I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament' s position.	92.9032449104735
Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far.	38.40714380831156
They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues.	35.514822663078
Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines.	35.66360728850721
As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development.	22.59732332584688
This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again.	44.05345194044366
Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands.	31.738537991420024
Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all.	77.74038449666543
The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly.	48.319783718417035
As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May.	30.396366334686753
I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes.	37.63227056035427
Mr President, Commissioner, in this minute and a half I should like, first of all, to congratulate Mrs Schroedter.	38.16685710483129
I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.	111.51278662594154
I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity.	76.89737077403159
Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003.	75.06529891681537
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	32.709667739690595
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies.	40.32568951741775
Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking.	140.99912347961563
We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?	96.40483880431674
The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms.	88.60299618363125
These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.	30.770327052695936
Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds.	28.65852185787676
As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation.	50.709976225281295
Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want.	102.06317680057057
Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations.	70.85084958410108
I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.	88.78965561255832
I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.	75.95369899294892
Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form.	135.66584317589923
As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country.	49.335819516434704
Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process.	69.1026971726169
Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator.	77.42022092285251
Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds.	44.06590891773601
What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level.	55.05983577630394
The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner.	209.43143770405763
The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere.	122.11469904666572
It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.	30.956882879952545
This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it.	6.055669782279497
Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work.	5.68511045004451
Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy.	127.4823266010866
To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds.	35.00362097309452
For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	62.22600619388894
For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level.	71.14922772325328
There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided.	32.41595693539537
Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.	53.36092830317524
I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern.	41.624767499063275
Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular.	40.63897120027117
But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.	53.62847297786867
The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability.	66.76995324113756
That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.	71.42450128705765
I would like to explain our thinking here.	228.86610639828226
Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.	22.45241285182125
Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.	97.66997268895561
Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period.	66.11335901283469
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	98.14802515886272
Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.	105.69724997421007
Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed.	86.35727789823841
There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation.	95.32343680343294
Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see.	91.5183653128034
That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.	55.54636046021067
If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up".	65.264945120731
I urge the House to support these changes.	33.85768336010303
Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work.	23.63913715317717
The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions.	50.33685533780515
Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment.	167.866245932633
These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines.	113.37257000159192
Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life.	132.0594394329891
Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland.	32.19810397882784
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.	37.44461454578446
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	22.68218681236164
However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy.	35.74093373420219
Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it.	36.04425883296548
The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South.	42.18860159152361
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	37.4245069470248
If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities.	37.80073214447
Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation.	69.50966043155631
The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy.	38.82158827257496
A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots.	72.39982920613213
Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented.	47.8567192168694
Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union.	36.73293213299663
The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion.	24.109582799489136
We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously.	132.5521579127615
We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives.	18.567010450494543
Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention.	31.51994062929197
In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira.	31.648031116886727
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament?	21.252718431893253
Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made.	38.39320755954086
Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes.	52.24710195468031
However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas.	38.8286985616378
Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities.	89.86701421503406
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	99.89838891414608
I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	35.08286834347024
I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations.	87.35910129757447
Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women.	32.9534121408295
Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions.	53.536682788774165
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	49.995686882254
They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions.	51.16680336610313
Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem.	28.139070435102553
Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require.	58.824004442665355
Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	39.63346000781814
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.	36.912850873938964
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.	110.6287999422146
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report.	17.182512735380733
Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.	48.06115486159179
Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.	38.59283185998319
So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.	44.75300424372388
Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds.	42.79838390949765
This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	89.70351969102549
The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies.	72.0283744774355
When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels.	66.78207478752797
And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund.	45.748669168064545
This is the purpose of these guidelines.	20.671270895825273
Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now.	67.66550390348927
The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales.	49.95059757190418
And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.	51.982080928457385
Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report.	53.26415606356288
Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation.	47.98746682072184
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	51.2952885204992
I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter.	50.97234626551831
So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.	89.539220148512
The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.	80.06452047034472
Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment - as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable.	69.31036761275746
As far as I am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.	60.77291136662704
The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy.	58.003226047790555
In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time.	114.60226616370919
I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.	39.361493979773115
Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines.	68.8948096788805
However, I do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership - and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.	53.72134262968217
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.	37.796210392817564
I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure.	43.38565285566388
It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date.	112.61124125778335
Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately.	34.07469031773993
Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999.	56.41735307646973
Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration.	42.025762564585676
And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.	40.65199361757943
Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided.	66.31447717058248
I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.	81.05119645726027
Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter.	43.18189277343569
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	72.28557768513285
This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations.	57.959268075526
The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies.	54.13919315293467
I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks.	280.568277688666
Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.	50.245512474834754
You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	39.88809918462208
I find the opposite the case.	96.28548044262057
I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy.	60.058868923184114
Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.	57.27588654976868
As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe' s rural heritage.	61.98390702243823
It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority.	72.73212697443006
And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture.	79.65515886889436
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions.	24.674502777273553
In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.	17.013721826138458
Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France.	32.675224091496176
I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2.	89.14430020264392
I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow.	40.178613803439966
We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms.	40.29993462262733
Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.	94.80184227853943
In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view.	27.97880677818621
I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes.	57.308830110344715
This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.	59.36917073426183
The debate is closed.	1.0
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.765906063781515
Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union	10.96999059609521
The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)].	5.663514556692299
Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report.	20.15003060856148
I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	96.50826385903245
The Commission report generally relativises this observation, particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the Union in which I have a special interest, by which I mean the French overseas departments and, more generally, the most remote regions.	34.4893963696417
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.	24.868834450393035
Finally, in my view, this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of Europe, particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of Europe and its more remote regions.	59.81298884880246
Even if the Commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the Community area through the Union' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the SEC.	46.70032708279001
Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this Parliament agrees with the report that Mr Berend has just presented and congratulates the author, both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility, which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee.	34.276839660951985
It must be remembered that, currently, the European Union' s overall competitiveness is, in general terms, 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units, that is the regions, also improves. Furthermore, this is at a time when technological development, economic globalisation and our problems, which are enlargement and the single currency, demand that the regions, as well as businesses and individuals, make more of an effort to be competitive.	79.5711041447182
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions.	328.0736445418211
I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative.	118.17948332053435
The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities.	63.410297551961975
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.	81.19078966334563
It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation.	197.82108173361152
This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.	27.726669999678048
Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.	33.37877343961308
Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it.	26.358424275531327
The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims.	19.60580871710458
The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts.	143.0269315830397
Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe.	225.73845547906052
The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly.	160.27823291794846
We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas.	75.63693330621803
Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions?	70.15692413478425
How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development?	54.55236513460749
It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas.	38.28737549914409
The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility.	29.74612950701422
Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased.	79.89875418774818
This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced.	44.70506134687928
In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place.	54.12710567331527
For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration.	25.495564999565094
In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development.	76.00751639676977
It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how.	177.13709428403396
Our Group is in favour of adopting this report.	18.591918742826216
Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	57.91652900775842
We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%.	84.02385028835532
Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007.	62.31825921572304
There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects.	52.42049699530856
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore.	28.6853821110886
The overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation, boosting equality of opportunity, increasing the sustainability of employment and development, are only mentioned in passing.	69.15217246962739
This attitude appears to me to be unjustified. I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.	32.92252478295142
This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises.	34.51932269146657
It is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the Objective 1 Regions, that is to say job creation measures, special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business.	65.53039392555527
They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.	135.42211088799635
Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions.	44.15554605935276
After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all.	81.08432469084812
Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.	63.51269198099886
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation.	70.4833578413911
It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.	36.028097604518045
The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.	85.89776056359132
In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there.	62.208308001287406
For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again.	82.35817290557272
Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report.	18.86432053872358
The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.	12.830156956037532
By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment.	26.57106368806298
From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect.	52.86107536058427
The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth.	40.010400729796615
As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned.	65.39742868546399
Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.	47.38649578864679
Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions.	92.64212196171583
Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment.	59.58613447772164
It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit.	237.04385731870155
By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved.	95.28637146295041
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.	43.6209143735025
I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.	26.23150990188938
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	130.3415485620647
By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on.	32.29333290069613
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.	13.764360802995402
The report shows that, in general, they are a long way behind EU countries, especially in terms of GDP per capita.	65.46340755575243
With the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future, it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy. I would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the Commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later.	23.375774293448913
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.	67.33453474552455
For example, whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased, there has been a certain amount of convergence between the Member States themselves in this respect.	30.2192280687218
Equally, unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all, indeed they rose in some cases.	78.86265056213668
I wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently.	40.52130250774528
Even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries.	33.33173548781087
Since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout Europe to reduce unemployment, then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development, improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training.	87.76197837224709
Genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base.	143.96606446158634
If we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term, then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed.	74.44554872983392
We will only be able to say that the structural policy of the Union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate.	24.56000693278378
Mr President, Commissioner, my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report, because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of Europe will judge that we have been successful in our work.	46.60060811818666
This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility.	75.0342699376071
It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries.	41.42718021378732
I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago.	96.81543900824695
In this connection, French speakers would speak of a "coup de chapeau" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU.	45.20716986895465
The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great.	91.38971093548862
What is the result?	1.0
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	133.63007465239738
Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over.	63.8294727679588
This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems.	81.18086746335759
Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there.	53.94163003745041
We must give them this opportunity.	26.42640803400902
This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have.	46.283889670025644
The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship.	259.20230001745716
By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will.	136.3413128243711
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.	169.9043069164545
What is a fair society?	940.7754449386996
One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children.	132.67303299454983
In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance.	87.19141872927685
Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe.	67.8576190382843
Mr President, Commissioner, as my time is limited, I shall get straight to the point.	113.37100436321609
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	42.2219164707176
The most remote regions, still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates, offer one example of this.	137.95165867265447
In Reunion, for example, the rate is 37%.	641.1694453211156
This is not a situation related to the economic climate, however; rather it is a structural problem, created by our remoteness, our insularity, in short, our own specific personality.	162.44701320160712
The principle of specific, exceptional treatment was envisaged in Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam in order to deal with such cases.	26.19821776870752
It only remains to put this principle into practice.	87.50006312778642
The Commission document expected to be ready in December 1999 was delayed until January, then February, and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism.	137.84489938180553
I therefore appeal formally to the Council and the Commission.	4.423812611655658
As regards taxation, state aid, the Structural Funds and defending our traditional products, practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency.	66.58043375316542
If these do not materialise, then, unfortunately, convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us, and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions, despite the size of the amounts committed, will end in failure.	90.89997621654204
Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report.	24.057651976678734
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.	55.42731162315887
I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report.	30.52771082990049
You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports.	64.13294716144804
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.	39.843904372456066
The Commission was certainly very anxious to ensure, Mr Berend, that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you.	40.992093700614575
I am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2.1 of this report, where the Commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported, improved and influenced by factors which some of you - Mr Markov, just now, and Mrs Raschhofer - stressed very forcefully.	68.53667258140004
I am thinking of technological research and development, infrastructure provision and quality, human resources potential, small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad.	101.03688861267005
So much for the quality.	450.5617058658335
I do not wish to spend time right now, Mr Berend, going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your House has already endorsed.	127.44055004747709
Let me just itemise them: the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy, particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the Member States.	27.112248424659
Secondly, partnership, a subject which a number of you stressed, the role of local and regional authorities, the private sector, both sides of industry, associations and local community action groups.	39.5508862031206
Regarding this problem of partnership, I shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the Structural Funds regulations are applied properly.	46.76484636823681
Thirdly, the need to develop the employment side of growth, even though I am aware, as Mr van Dam just said, that the prime responsibility is that of the Member States, and that, when we speak of the responsibility of Member States, and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy, we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in.	51.22603625348862
Mr Fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably.	47.66083584418739
Mr Fruteau, we at least need to recognise that there is growth, and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past.	24.9472488139093
You will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike.	336.5795302699889
I agree with your analysis.	1657.6270804680846
When there is growth, it must be better distributed, but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness, be they the most remote or island regions, is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades.	77.0060836457038
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people.	36.67484278931766
Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now.	52.73930564773393
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	47.591791361799444
In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds.	37.02443748036503
I should like to mention a few specific points.	25.64887676008898
Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly.	70.91814791063945
Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase.	43.85158042567037
Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn.	75.10309171816992
You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2.	42.950028761044265
Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data.	46.10997422576578
To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics.	33.64836226126238
Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector.	54.91266936944707
On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context.	43.05517462777234
This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler.	61.11456416751399
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.	38.974049990103985
Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these.	79.79015808074884
I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	44.83341354555251
In any event, I have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report: the definition, compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned, particularly Mrs Sudre and Mr Fruteau; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. This will constitute a great challenge to us all, for you and for the Commission, in the next few years.	34.88950708356952
And finally, there are the cross-border aspects. I shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points.	81.73724411057589
Finally, I should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are, in any case, familiar with, but whose main elements I should like to reiterate.	48.74203741567368
Ladies and gentlemen, considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence, particularly for the four cohesion countries, but also frankly, Mr Pohjamo, for the Objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development, especially regarding infrastructure.	79.35913622828646
This is my first point regarding the policy.	27.373317170429367
My second point regarding the policy is as follows: the Structural Funds have made, and continue to make, a significant contribution to the convergence process.	39.09401732298232
All the macroeconomic models we are working on show that, over the last decade, more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the Structural Funds.	46.57401718206654
I have, however, taken note, particularly with regard to the most remote regions, Mrs Sudre, Mr Fruteau, and Mr Nogueira Román too, that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take-up aspects, the fight against social exclusion, which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions, and the integration of women and young people into the labour market.	37.65929541133021
Now to my fourth point regarding the policy; enlargement of the Union, the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions, the major challenge, too, for the European policy on cohesion, a point which Mr van Dam highlighted.	69.48145849035572
I shall say that something is already taking shape in Berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us.	53.03560419617348
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks.	26.03200626309797
You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy.	61.042848716155696
This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself.	105.33095679600146
I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006.	21.2787426630603
Thank you very much, Commissioner.	2.7766501901898972
The debate is closed.	1.0
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	1.765906063781515
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)	6.716761153934275
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting	4.336191974933679
The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed.	3.66729984664871
Are there any comments?	1.0
Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes.	18.565678337568965
I refer to item 11 on the order of business.	60.59241640551269
Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated.	32.83860065888393
I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group.	42.99728817182641
The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission.	53.63185740477444
We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were.	48.33653784833802
There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this.	32.08883531458041
When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance.	154.24422739551957
There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission.	26.84998356022686
We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships.	124.42756464892561
Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly.	66.05301278053945
That is something for which I have a deep appreciation.	46.18340169300463
I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	69.18220318294973
It should not be dramatised into something more than that.	45.421123443702456
Thank you very much, Mr Cox.	22.41348023213382
I understand what you are saying.	18.437145683540493
We have taken note of this.	2.9767909797545733
Mr President, concerning item 11 of the Minutes on the order of business, we agreed yesterday to have the Bourlanges report on today's agenda.	54.484717014376095
However, it was withdrawn from the Committee on Budgets last night without being discussed or voted on.	33.57989751586378
It therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda.	36.18209589060529
Mr Wynn, that makes sense.	14.850824582148899
The report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda.	9.86632999914742
Mr President, regarding Mrs Lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building, I presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the Tower.	56.933730699198435
This needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong.	101.29370053683166
I do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly, but this is a serious problem.	21.53969090055504
Mrs Ahern, we have taken note of this.	15.337123242503848
I would ask you to bring this specific case, which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor, to the attention of the Quaestors, who are, in fact, responsible for the matter.	40.585609317817045
We will also pass this on to our services, however.	312.80746587498527
Thank you very much.	1.0
(The Minutes were approved)	1.0
Reform of European competition policy	1.5962368987905404
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:	12.950416129365355
A5-0069/1999 by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty [COM(1999) 101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)];	4.892618136251504
A5-0078/1999 by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy 1998 [SEK(1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)];	5.403741509194872
A5-0087/1999 by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors. [COM(1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS)] (Report 1995-1997);	6.9952115575106495
A5-0073/1999 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission Report on the implementation in 1998 of Commission Decision No. 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (Steel Aid Code). [COM(1999) 94 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107(COS)].	9.958160190907943
Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy.	21.049271605429553
We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe.	46.02190931702287
I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term "modernisation" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression "retrograde step" .	32.33889878816302
However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter.	91.58098568905748
But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper.	173.74638331432513
It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.	20.62852114100252
On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us.	130.03982785426484
Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned.	97.1958285010656
It should continue along this path.	17.63169208525484
But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation.	54.50786540918503
Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned.	73.66402344882034
Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency.	121.87857432378077
The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon.	59.15966787310045
Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together.	89.69583548548223
I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.	29.448466873514842
The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?	101.15883923509982
Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it.	151.05808658490398
There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous.	51.26967371739346
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	24.89368440286312
I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo.	239.37207320337615
I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.	99.56296187967529
This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.	35.72786135920061
With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself.	37.09471046443239
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.	105.37633053808842
At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue.	76.77279650400422
Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.	88.52615900219396
But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.	146.39819454142986
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example.	110.21937766687017
But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation.	650.7319731924983
Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible.	308.6171062288111
However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it.	77.2967634977542
It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy.	31.26125407897534
Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition.	48.52120424630558
This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible.	57.6649483401637
It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives.	51.374857098771166
My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party.	11.272392642991562
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	23.830707632773702
The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued.	32.69909557459802
Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.	44.772364539687324
To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	56.907967524369674
This being the case, there are considerable disparities between states, which may be measured in various ways, such as, for example, as a percentage of added value and per wage earner.	51.44077561389934
I think it is also interesting to add state aid and Community aid, which may be assimilated in some way into state aid.	60.11458504179482
This clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the Cohesion Fund, among other things, which come at the top of the list.	40.19436203161103
This being the case, let me now come to the proposals made in the report.	35.59135286078468
We note, first of all, that the committee considers the data, as presented in the Commission' s annual report, to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in-depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate, sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition, pursuant to the actual terms of the Treaty.	50.52988184647877
The Commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the Member States.	13.936088461380896
It is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided, and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect.	40.233021597400125
It is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example, has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid, accessible via the Internet.	58.86439413324954
Having better, more detailed information available, particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded, must make it possible for the European Commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies.	55.17776087749543
And insofar as such studies already exist, to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the Treaties, which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the European economy, but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion.	26.95294866999236
By stressing, primarily, the quality of the information provided, our debate in committee, and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you, avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was, in absolute terms, either too high or not high enough.	60.596503070866966
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	39.16292706113612
This being the case, various amendments to the rapporteur' s initial draft report were adopted in committee, particularly highlighting the need for effective reimbursement of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results.	55.23410617298311
Seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting.	33.12523612097677
Most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid, in view of the inadequacies, acknowledged or not, of private investment alone, the market failures or inadequacies of the market.	95.54878935817784
There is in particular one amendment, let me point out, concerning the energy sector, which, in my capacity as rapporteur, I see as particularly important.	104.11641201512698
I should like to conclude this presentation, Commissioner, by stressing two things: firstly, a concern of the members of the committee and, secondly, a demand of our committee.	81.67903710081345
The concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in terms of competition policy and state aid.	14.153520887151851
This is undoubtedly a complex issue, and one where we should like to see the Commission informing us of the latest development in the matter, particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and, as far as state aid is concerned, the need, in all probability, to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors.	45.819451509715286
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.	39.23628157508096
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.	54.32853179253687
Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission.	31.306358974894714
There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these.	62.50543505495495
The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly.	95.91181496603228
Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future.	60.42583363718648
The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty.	61.17775358855749
The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament.	43.37273887033984
As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry.	30.59126094713344
According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases.	139.36606015034664
Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid.	27.597729579303273
In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany.	57.70100807311946
Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid.	74.3406134242445
The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996.	56.38445984222881
These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether.	69.25604973570628
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	68.29339625797981
However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report.	50.867810368203834
As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired.	63.426492500774565
There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code.	27.87476623922121
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	43.395408364094195
This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years.	23.451365643984484
Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	31.380558367251115
We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind.	49.48533780453826
The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	34.66889906311026
We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	57.44059796262943
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.	58.86817359209657
A Council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments.	56.73611552982707
What we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets.	61.82647874345944
We also need to criticise the Commission' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view, do not fall within the categories of the code, even given the fact that the European Court of Justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned.	72.97194328960629
The Commission will be called upon, in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999, to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions, thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made.	64.405182747971
Once the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions, I would ask that we make full use of this opportunity, which we have ourselves created, in plenary sitting.	54.88080320888856
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market is not complete.	23.976441526416103
Subsidies, monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike.	58.94191666311036
National governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time, but then it happens again.	51.77050921541235
Subsidies distort allocations, both within and between countries.	78.74955263662115
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	49.34752193684413
This applies to those which have been turned into monopolies, both private and public.	132.55500623847075
Public monopolies are, more often than not, phased out reluctantly.	113.17244030113298
Increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare, including within the spheres of education, health care and social services.	44.445317179737586
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	107.15816918247252
Europe must be modernised, made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies.	41.2683703596758
Effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living.	66.00020542608893
It is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently.	228.2901830457186
In fact, competition policy and consumer policy belong together.	166.91559851114317
The internal market is the basis for our work.	44.25584693841609
Its legislation is to apply equally to all, to large and small countries alike.	231.1580023727596
A systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled.	85.632228006556
The EU' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed.	135.09687644102704
The new model now being tested by the Commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy.	48.154399629525145
In order to be effective, it must be well anchored in the Member States' national authorities.	28.458762835475454
In six months' time, it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation' s effects upon the Commission' s role.	28.977048985284778
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	112.14543441054832
This will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed.	47.33392387533946
There will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate.	68.49257209732957
The law must be correctly applied in matters of competition.	135.78697479555063
Wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership, which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for.	65.86857364832835
We have a quite exciting debate in front of us.	185.49729063777514
A conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings, at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points.	70.15952683117067
Parliament and the Commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens.	110.98458479527389
In fact, in my own constituency of Stockholm, we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies.	126.21725809773159
We would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by Mr von Wogau and Mr Rapkay.	27.291492456296684
We hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law.	39.86314381014002
Mr President, as a new Member I am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today, even though there has been a delay.	30.515363449417272
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs Mr von Wogau, Mr Langen, Mr Rapkay and Mr Jonckheer, as well as the Commission, for their excellent cooperation.	21.190703401020894
Competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and European competition policy is a success story; take the energy and telecommunications sectors, where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service.	43.854483624923716
All this is to the good of the consumer.	140.3030448719187
But we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further.	38.24182888285223
The Commission has put forward a new White Paper on this containing two key points: dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	30.86909975677903
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs, at any rate.	113.24688019778556
At the same time, this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world, of course.	64.98847829303124
It will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved; for one thing, each person will have to take responsibility themselves, and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters.	128.43753018359766
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape.	37.87370672773472
The second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement.	16.959873764734954
If we are to create a culture of law in Europe, then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the Commission, by central bodies, but also by national authorities, by national courts.	31.783403033100306
We are not discussing the fact that although every EU law is only ever decided on centrally, it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty.	80.39198715569019
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	51.0085426963426
The way to a European monopolies commission must be kept clear, something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion.	187.1627429933614
But we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy.	22.44147461032433
Parliament must have more involvement and I also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted, then this would encourage the Member States to be more disciplined.	46.79229210282764
However, when it comes to what the future holds for competition, there are two issues dear to my heart.	95.67668797940557
One is subsidiarity.	1.0
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.	51.94962611521558
Competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the European Union.	61.92202379448273
I would cite, by way of example, the issue of job creation schemes, savings banks and regional banks, and Gütesiegel.	70.02115210326299
Here, a region has, by its own efforts, created a means of marketing its own products.	218.1546938043078
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention.	75.68340518414618
I believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation.	38.927546327886624
We should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other.	53.756706273825536
My second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy, although I am not going to talk about market failure just now.	53.41785394809179
I have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector, but I would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters.	43.385131744890394
These days, someone who lives in an old people' s home is accommodated within the social field.	61.76357242603501
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	68.19753170749475
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.	125.86686535685939
To conclude, I would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity. I believe it to be of vital importance that where Member States allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes, they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by Europe.	52.32708557647437
Thank you very much, Mr Radwan.	26.492751086747244
I would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in German parliamentary-speak, inappropriately in your case, as a maiden speech.	60.01646796840302
Mr President, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of my fellow Member, Robert Goebbels, who is unable to attend due to a political commitment.	16.848263753296575
Within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the Jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market.	18.049461267735513
A slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures.	129.80157971220686
Even if the majority in this House were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market, it would not make any difference to the real world.	46.488588989003354
Economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources.	85.99025389490401
While, since the dawn of time, the market has been the key forum for human interchange, it has never been perfect.	68.09861028209409
The market favours the short term and immediate profits.	201.04153609947898
On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties, consumers and workers.	93.09894438015954
In order to function, the market needs rules.	304.74238434547135
The necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society.	85.25137440984916
We European Socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose.	39.36950431561397
The market is not an end in itself; it must help to improve the human condition.	77.20021182565159
The European Union or individual States must not take over from economic operators, but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion.	128.72594196411399
Finally, aid can enable restructuring, offer training, save jobs and thus know-how.	529.2181022028508
The main objective of the Union' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid.	28.884367913488486
This aid must be aligned with the objectives of the Union, particularly economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.	34.804988666403965
The Commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market.	43.19382077434648
It would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid.	81.08402830678202
The Internet is not a product of the market, but the result of research financed by the American army.	50.824591477184946
The World Wide Web, which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society, was developed by CERN in Geneva, once again with public aid.	59.0974631204382
The German Government' s intervention to save the Holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy.	57.777759133959094
President Duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness, the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism.	52.18990418111124
I did not hear Mr Duisenberg criticising the intervention of the American monetary authorities to save the hedge fund, LTCM.	41.31616628177801
Wishing to save 60 000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market.	58.841966736337746
Public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation, as was the case in Mexico, Asia and Brazil.	26.48194184760281
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	40.57958819229428
We Socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point.	60.116666957187164
We want a true culture of competition in Europe.	56.394523169770174
The state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the Commission must act as judge.	68.46074254045344
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.	18.69905405671627
I want to thank you, Commissioner Monti, for your outstanding cooperation and I want to tell you that, as we enter the new millennium, you have an especially important role.	40.43144461694264
It is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments. These may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy, but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless.	61.23597416289209
Let me mention the latest examples we have seen: Holzmann, a company which receives considerable aid from the German Government; sawmills in former East Germany; and, especially, aid to shipyards.	68.99611570482541
These are three areas in which many Danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets.	43.66701602327649
I want to say to Mr Poos that I very much agree with Mr Duisenberg that these examples show that some EU Member States are not in a position to restructure their economies and, to that extent, are helping to undermine the value of the euro.	39.69835369007958
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee, all concerning state aid.	26.186741226960294
These are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness, which is very important with a view to making the internal market work.	34.16233125948619
I should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party.	7.999455532331126
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	53.23261854828357
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful.	80.43115232416119
How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back?	30.163222964518724
At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment.	23.490541729921944
This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition.	25.194021152116793
Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid.	57.03116086867821
You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard.	152.53920816091215
It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid.	27.05027412521591
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter.	42.326549355215775
To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done.	17.64251724451013
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	89.21457052148207
There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid.	31.243491826890214
This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition.	30.171381767384734
As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems.	63.846397316238956
Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered.	68.08245160754743
Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy?	152.0693261667123
